# OrderedArrayList

NoNullArrayList:
We discussed how we should replace the two add and the set method so that the user would not be able to add or set null values into the ArrayList. If the user did try to do such thing, then it would return an IllegalValueException.
A confusion that we cleared up is while we thought we were supposed to go through the list to make sure that there is no null already in the List, we realized that we supposed to make sure that no nulls were being added.


OrderedArrayList:
We discussed that we would use a for loop and compareTo to determine the index the added object should be added to so that it is added to the right place to make sure that the ArrayList stays in order. 
A misconception that we had was that some of us thought that we would be intaking an ArrayList, organizing that and then added, but we cleared it up by realizing that we are to start with a brand new ArrayList that is adding it in a way so that it is always in order.
